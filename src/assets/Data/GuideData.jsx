     <h2>Home Loans with Borrowly</h2>
<p>
  Getting a home loan can seem overwhelming, but with Borrowly, it’s smooth and straightforward. 
  Here’s everything you need to know—step by step—to make your dream home a reality.
</p>
<br />

<h2>1. Find Out How Much You Can Borrow</h2>
<p>
  Wondering if you qualify? Borrowly helps you quickly check your eligibility based on your income, 
  age, job type, and credit score. It’s like a quick eligibility checkup to see how much home loan 
  you can get.
</p>
<br />

<h2>2. Pick the Right Loan Amount and Repayment Plan</h2>
<p>
  Decide how much you want to borrow and how long you want to take to repay it. Typically, loans cover 
  <strong>75–90% of your property’s value</strong>. You can choose a repayment tenure that fits your budget—from a few years up to 20 years or more. 
  Longer tenure means smaller monthly payments but more interest overall.
</p>
<br />

  Don’t worry, Borrowly makes document submission hassle-free. You’ll just need basic stuff like

<br />

<h2>4. Submit Your Application & Get Approved</h2>
<p>
  Once you apply, Borrowly takes care of forwarding your documents to the lender. They’ll review everything 
  and send you a <strong>sanction letter</strong> if all looks good. This letter outlines your loan amount, 
  interest rate, and terms.
</p>
<br />

<h2>5. Property Verification</h2>
<p>
  Before going ahead, the lender will double-check your property legally and technically—just to be sure it’s all legit.
</p>
<br />

<h2>6. Sign the Papers & Get Your Loan</h2>
<p>
  After verification, you’ll sign the loan agreement. Easy! The loan amount usually goes straight to your 
  builder or property seller.
</p>
<br />

<h2>7. Start Repaying with Easy EMIs</h2>
<p>
  Pay back your loan in small monthly installments called <strong>EMIs</strong>, covering both principal and interest. 
  Some loans even offer flexible pre-EMI options during construction.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Pro Tips for Borrowly Borrowers:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Get <strong>pre-approved</strong> on Borrowly before house hunting to save time and negotiate better.</li>
  <li>Keep an eye on your <strong>credit score</strong> (aim for 750+) to score the best interest rates.</li>
  <li>Use Borrowly’s calculators to estimate your <strong>EMI</strong> and loan eligibility.</li>
  <li>Watch out for extra charges like processing fees or prepayment penalties.</li>
  <li>Need help? Borrowly’s support team and FAQs are there to guide you 24/7.</li>
